### Built With

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### Acknowledgements

It was a nice experience that taught me how to create reusable React hooks and components, furthermore, I learnt to use node packages (such as emailjs) to send emails without a back-end server. Creating a button to switch themes was something that I struggled with at the beginning, but after using React context and local storage it became a really easy task.
In short, it was a challenge where I could use React and all the features it brings to make the interface-building process much easier.

### Challenges

-   Creating a responsive design that looks amazing on every screen.
-   Integrating an email service with a React app.
-   Using High-Order compontens (HOCs) in order to create reusable React components.
-   Adding a button that allows the user to switch between the page themes.
-   Creating a custom hook to manage a Form's data and state.
